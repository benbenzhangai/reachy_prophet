# Tarot Card Meanings Reference

This reference provides core themes and interpretive guidance for each card. Use this to inform position-aware interpretations but avoid mechanical keyword-matching—synthesize meanings contextually.

## How to Use This Reference

1. **Position matters**: The same card means different things in Past vs Advice positions
2. **Context matters**: Interpret based on the question (career, relationship, personal growth)
3. **Reversals are modulation, not negation**: Reversed ≠ "opposite"; it often means blocked, internalized, or excessive
4. **Synthesize across cards**: Look for patterns, tensions, and narrative threads

## Synthesis Guidelines

When weaving cards into a narrative:

1. **Identify the dominant element**: Which suit/energy dominates? (Wands=action, Cups=emotion, Swords=thought, Pentacles=material)

2. **Look for tensions**: Where do cards conflict? (e.g., Eight of Pentacles in Past + Two of Swords in Present = hard work led to decision paralysis)

3. **Track transformations**: How does energy shift from Past → Present → Future?

4. **Notice court cards**: These often represent aspects of self, others, or needed qualities

5. **Major Arcana weight**: Major cards indicate soul-level themes or significant life chapters; when multiple appear, the stakes are higher

6. **Reversed cards pattern**: Many reversals suggest internal work, resistance, or blocked energy

7. **Suit progression**: Aces = beginnings, mid-numbers = development, 8-10 = culmination
